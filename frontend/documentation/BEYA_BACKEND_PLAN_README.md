# Beya Backend Implementation Plan
## Agentic Context-Powered Business Platform - 10 Seat Pilot

> **Mission**: Build an AI business assistant ("B") that delivers "wow, I didn't know that" moments by analyzing real-time business data to surface previously hidden insights through context-aware interactions.

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

**What We're Building**: A real-time context engine that ingests data from Shopify, Business Central BI, and HubSpot to deliver actionable insights through an LLM-powered interface.

**Key Innovation**: Context-aware AI that understands what users are doing RIGHT NOW and surfaces relevant insights at the perfect moment.

**Goal**: 10 pilot users experiencing 3+ "wow moments" per week through Command-B chat and proactive notifications.

                                                                    ‚Üì
Platform Activity ‚Üí Real-time Tracking ‚Üí Behavior Analysis ‚Üí Context Boosting
                                                                    ‚Üì
EventBridge ‚Üí Chunking ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí Pinecone Vector DB ‚Üí RAG ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Insights
```

### Core Infrastructure
- **Event Schema**: Unified format with source tracking, user context, and intent metadata
- **Vector Storage**: 4 specialized Pinecone indexes
  - `customer-context`: All customer interactions
  - `sales-pipeline`: Deal flow and timing patterns  
  - `team-activity`: Individual and team performance
  - `user-intent`: Real-time platform behavior (hot partition)
- **Intelligence Layer**: GPT-4 primary, GPT-3.5 fallback
- **Interface**: Command-B chat + proactive modal notifications

## ‚ö° **Key Technical Innovations**

### 1. Intent-Driven Context Boosting
```python
# Dynamic vector weighting based on current user activity
if user_viewing_customer_profile:
    boost_customer_vectors(customer_id)
elif user_in_sales_dashboard: 
    boost_pipeline_vectors(time_range)
elif user_searching:
    boost_search_related_vectors(query)
```

### 2. Smart Insight Timing
- **Don't Interrupt**: Only show insights when user is receptive
- **Enhance Workflow**: Surface insights related to current task
- **Context Triggers**: 
  - Viewing customer ‚Üí Recent changes
  - Sales dashboard ‚Üí Pipeline risks
  - Active search ‚Üí Related insights
  - Page dwell time ‚Üí Deeper analysis

### 3. Intelligent Chunking
- **Order events**: Full order + customer context
- **Communications**: Sliding window with conversation history
- **CRM updates**: Changed fields + related entities
- **Negative space**: Generate "missing action" events

## **üìã OAuth2 Implementation Checklist:**

For each platform, you'll need:

‚ñ° App registration (get client_id/secret)
‚ñ° OAuth2 flow endpoints (authorize, token, refresh)
‚ñ° Token storage with encryption
‚ñ° Token refresh mechanism
‚ñ° Connection status tracking
‚ñ° Webhook endpoint registration
‚ñ° Initial data sync capability

Once you have OAuth2 working and data flowing in, then you can tackle:
- Event ingestion pipeline
- Vectorization
- Context engine

Want to start with the OAuth2 framework architecture? I can help you design the Lambda functions and database schema needed for secure token management and connection tracking.
